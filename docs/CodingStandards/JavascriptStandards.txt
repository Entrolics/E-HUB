Coding Standards

We want to keep the standards as simple as possible so it doesn't cross our productivity.
Feel free to add or modify the standards.

Should we run in strict mode? (I think we should use strict mode)

JavaScript
	Names(as descriptive as possible):
		1. file names                   'NameLikeThis'      except Main like this 'main' (each word with it's first letter capital)
		2. variable names               'camelCaseLikeThis' 
		3. constant variable names      'CONSTANTLIKETHIS'  (all capital)
		4. global variable names        'g_LIKETHIS'        (all capital starting with small g followed by underscore)
		5. (method &&|| function) names 'camelCaseLikeThis' or 'CamelCaseLikeThis'(with first letter capital)
		6. class names                  'NameLikeThis'
		7. class as data struct names   'SNameLikeThis'     starting with capital S
		8. Interface names              'INameLikeThis'     starting with capital I
	
	Format:
		shoud we use tool like uncrustify to clean the code? such as extra blank lines,tabs,spaces,new lines etc.
		
		Functions:
			1. split the function in 2 if it exceeds more than 80 lines (if it's splittable)
			2. generify if possible
		Classes:
			1. include static main method with some test cases so that each module can be independently tested
			2. getter and setter for public variables
			3. generify if possible
			4. debug function which will print all the necessary info formatted
			5. Must include modifiablle logLevel(1-3) member which will define the debug || log level and should log || print info accordingly
		Interfaces:
			1. should avoid using as data structs?
			2. generify if possible
		Classes as structs:
			1. no need of getter and setter
			2. 'toString' function which would format and return a string of all the data fields
		Comments:
			1. Follow JSDocs conventions.
			2. provide a short summary of module's over all functionality
